This is a site made for my beautiful friend Paige! It's just a basic set-up, but hopefully it's enough to get her going on her web-dev career/world domination MWAHAHAHAHA

<div class="nav navi-2">
<?php print $nav2; ?>

So what's going on here? Well here's the specs:
<ul>
<li> You now have your domain! lovelymeraki.com!!
<li> You also have a rackspace server for hosting!
<li> I've set you up with Git so you can easily work locally and push to you production site! (Hey it's how I built it)
<li> Less important, but you also have a 24/7 support contract with me! Haha not very exciting, but any help you need I'm here :)
</ul>
</p>
</div>

<div class="nav navi-3">
<?php print $nav3; ?>
</div>

<div id="p3" class="hidden">
<p>

Well, if there's one thing I wish I knew/had know more about it was the server side and version control aspects of web development so I though cooking this up was a good way of getting that under control for you! Now you can build, push, and pull your way to success!
